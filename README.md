## Notes from Kelvin
The guide from the GitHub was the main procedure to follow: https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium.

I used Conda to install the gymnasium environment. I also followed this video as I was encountering some issues:https://youtu.be/gMgj4pSHLww?si=Te5ipd9G6TL-Keow. I needed to install the Microsoft C++ Build Tools for Windows in addition to the gymnasium requirements.
